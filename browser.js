// Puppeteer has a .launch() method that launches an instance of a browsers. This method returns a Promise, so you have to  make sure
// the Promise resolves by using a .then or await block
// Note that: method .launch() method takes a JSON parameter with several values:
// + headless: false: means the browser will run with an interface so you can watch your script execute, while true means the browser
// will run in headless mode. Note that if you want to deploy your scraper to the cloud, set headless back to true
// + ignoreHTTPSErrors - true allows you to visit websites that arenâ€™t hosted over a secure HTTPS protocol and ignore any HTTPS-related errors.
